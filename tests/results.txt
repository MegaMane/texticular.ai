Command >> Look at the floor.
Output >>  I don't see a floor here.

Command >> Look at the rabbit ears
Output I don't see rabbit ears here!

All interaction with the rabbit ears as defined in my "GameInteractions.txt" is broken. The rabbit ears are not properly in the room.
 in fact trying to "move the rabbit ears" crashed the game!

Command >> Take the Genie
Taken


Command >> Talk to the Genie
I don't see a Genie here

I thought this had to do with taking the genie but it shouldn't anything that is in the current location or the players 
inventory should be able to be recognized by the parser. However even after restarting the game and not taking the genie the Command
still fails returning 'I don't see a Genie here' and so does the command 'Talk to the bobblehead'

Command >> Turn on the TV
Output Command: "turn on the tv" does not star with a known verb

cant turn on the tv or turn off the tv or interact with it in any meaningful way as described in my GameInteractions.txt

Command >> Pickup the phone
Output Command: "pickup the phone" does not start with a known verb.

Phone interaction broken Command "Use the phone" crashed the game. No other commands worked and let me use the phone in any way

Bed Interction broken

You can only sit on the bed, not lay on it but once you do you can never get off the bed again. Game over. Game Breaking Bug.

Sheets - minor importance but the sheets don't really exist and we are supposed to be able to interact with them.
