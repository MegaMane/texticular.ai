# Texticular Project Analysis & Collaboration Plan

## Project Overview
**Texticular** is a text adventure game engine with a humorous game "Chapter 1: You Gotta Go!" about finding a bathroom after drinking "Fast Eddie's Colon Cleanse" in a seedy hotel.

## Current Status (Analysis Completed)
- **~70% complete** with solid technical foundation
- Sophisticated object-oriented engine with JSON-driven configuration
- Advanced command parser based on interactive fiction grammar
- Complete narrative design and world building
- 7 rooms mapped out with rich descriptions and puzzle mechanics

## What's Working
✅ Core architecture (GameObject, Room, StoryItem, Container classes)
✅ Room-to-room movement with locked/unlocked doors  
✅ Basic inventory and item system
✅ JSON configuration system for game data
✅ Complete story design with two victory paths

## What Needs Completion
❌ Parser integration issues (disconnect between parser and command handling)
❌ Custom action methods not properly wired up
❌ NPC dialogue system not implemented  
❌ Vending machine/shop mechanics missing
❌ Game state management (victory/defeat conditions)
❌ Save/load functionality

## Planned Collaboration Approach
**Phase 1: Environment Setup & Documentation**
- Create virtual environment and update markdown docs
- Establish coding standards and documentation conventions
- Review/enhance documentation structure

**Phase 2: Feature-by-Feature Development** 
- Work through `references/ToDo.md` systematically
- Each feature: implementation → code review → documentation → testing
- Add comprehensive docstrings (Google style) and inline comments
- Create detailed markdown guides for each system

**Phase 3: Knowledge Transfer Documentation**
- Engine architecture deep-dive with examples
- Parser system explanation with grammar rules  
- Game object lifecycle and interaction patterns
- Developer guides for extending the engine

## Next Session Goals
1. Set up Python virtual environment
2. Get basic game running and test movement
3. Enhance existing markdown documentation
4. Start with vending machine implementation (core gameplay unlock)

## Technical Priorities
1. Fix parser integration in `game_controller.py:95-136`
2. Implement action method wiring system 
3. Create vending machine as interactive object
4. Add janitor NPC with dialogue system
5. Implement dog treats puzzle (complete solution path)

## Key Files Reviewed
- `src/texticular/game_controller.py` - Main game loop and command handling
- `src/texticular/__main__.py` - Entry point  
- `references/ToDo.md` - Feature completion status
- `references/story.md` - Complete narrative and puzzle design
- `data/newGameMap.json` - Room configurations
- `data/newGameItems.json` - Item definitions

## Code Standards for Collaboration
- Google-style docstrings for all functions/classes
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit tests for each feature
- Markdown documentation for each system
