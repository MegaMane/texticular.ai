## Texticular: Chapter 1 - You Gotta Go!

Summary
You wake up with a pounding headache, disoriented in a strange dingy hotel room with no cash in your wallet. 
You vaguely remember signing up for some clinical trials for a new health drink that seems to have taken a strange turn
and the worst deuce you've ever had to drop is knocking hard at your door. When you try to run to the bathroom you are 
greeted by a very large and very angry great dane blocking the way. As you quickly leave your hotel room to use the bathroom
in the hotel lobby you come across a vending machine selling more of the infamous "Fast Eddie's Colon Cleanse" you apparently
were guzzling last night as well as some suspiciously placed "Sleepy Time Dog Treats". The problem is you woke up with no
money and were only able to scrounge up 50 cents from the hotel room nightstand and the fucking dog treats cost 2.50! So 

Game over Conditions
-------------------

If you drink any Fast Eddie's (Just 50 cents in the vending machine)<br>
(You Shit Yourself)

If you go into the bathroom in your hotel more than once without the sleepy time dog treats<br>
(The Great Dane Kills You)

If you lie down or sit down three times before you poop <br>
(You Shit Yourself)

If you don't use the toilet within a reasonable amount of real world time (like 20 minutes)<br>
(You Shit Yourself)

If you hurt the Bathroom Attenedant, Janitor, or Hotel Clerk<br>
(Security Beats the Shit out of You and You Shit Yourself)

If you go into the womens bathroom you are confused for the peeping Tom<br>
(You almost make it to the toilet but just as you sit down....Security Beats the Shit out of You and You Shit Yourself)

Victory Conditions
------------------

1). Give the Great Dane the Sleepy time treats and take a shit in your hotel room bathroom  
<i>or</i>  
2.) Get the Bathroom Token from the Hotel Clerk and shit in the hotel lobby bathroom  

How to get the Sleepy Time Dog Treats
------------------------------------
Open The Bathroom Door in your hotel room and look at the vending machine once to get the quest
"Scooby Snacks"

The sleepy time dog treats are in plain sight in the vending machine in the west hallway on the 2nd floor. 
They cost 2.50 along with a large selection of fast eddies (only 50 cents) and the player starts with 0. 

You can find 50 cents in the nightstand in room 201
Talk to the Janitor in the East Hallway and ask him to borrow some money
He'll refuse and go on about honest hard work and make a comment about the only time he leaves his post is
when nature calls. Then he'll put his cup of coffee down and continue working
Go back to the west hallway and buy a can of fast eddies from the vending machine and pour it in his drink
He will very suddenly get the urge to go and run to the bathroom dropping his keys to the supply closet
open the supply closet and search it to find the Janitor's Wig, ear plugs, the Magic Eight Ball Take all (though the magic eight
ball isn't necessary to get the sleepy time dog treats)

Talk to the peeping tom on the street to find out he is looking to go in deep cover
put on the wig and talk to the peeping tom and he will offer to buy it from you for 2 bucks
you can try pushing for three and see if you are lucky but you might have to settle for 2

if so knock on the door of room 202 and you'll get an angry response from the guy trying to sleep in there
since the horny couple is keeping him up. Offer to take care of the problem and knock on the door of room 203 where you
won't get very far, but if you knock on room 202 and offer to sell him the ear plugs you found he will slide you a buck
under the door.

Buy the dog treats and give them to the great dane and finally enjoy your hard won dump. You've earned it!

Chapter 1 complete.

How to Get the Bathroom Token from the Hotel Clerk
-----------------------------
Talk to the bathroom attendant or try to use the bathroom in the lobby to find out that you need a bathroom token

To get the quest "My Kingdom for a Token!"

Talk to the hotel lobby clerk to find out there is a "national token shortage" and they are under strict token limits
unfortunately the bulk of the tokens are reserved for their "esteemed guests" on floors 3 and 4 and not for their 
complimentary guests on their condemned I mean historical floor. Remodeling courtesy of fast eddies generous sponsorship. 
He informs you you are welcome to use the bathroom in your room of course and when you tell him there is a rabid dog in 
there he laughs and says they will get on that for you right away sir in a fake british accent. He does let you know
there is one token available he would be willing to part with for a bargain 20 dollars. Since you have nowhere near that 
money that isn't an option. Ask him if there is anything he would be willing to trade for. He'll give you a smug look
and say if you bring him a {rare specific item} the token is all yours and you can punch him in the face and we won't even
call security.

Talk to the paranoid guy in room 204 and convince him blah blah blah
He will give you the puzzle box
He'll slide a card with a number on it under the door. 
Take the card and call the number from your room and ask for a drop off from Genie three wishes

The item will appear in the {something} outside

Bring it to the clerk and ask for the bathroom token oh yeah one more thing.... punch him in the face

Put the bathroom token in the stall and take a well deserved shit
 

## Scenes


### Opening Scene

#### <i>Location: Room 201</i>

 

You wake up disoriented with a pounding headache in a shabby looking hotel room 
surrounded by a bunch of empty cans. You've got a taste in your mouth like a dirty old rat crawled in and died in there.
Disoriented, you roll out of the bed you woke up in, barely avoiding some questionable stains on the sheets, as you stumble 
to your feet sending cans flying like bowling pins in your wake. You bend over to take a closer look at the
pile of crushed aluminum. You read one of the labels: "Fast Eddie's Colon Cleanse: When in doubt flush it out!"
"Side effects may include: Dizzines, vomiting, diarrhea, cold sweats, hallucinations, intense panic, 
paranoia, permanent tongue discoloration, mild brain damage, amnesia, bowel implosion, and occasionally hiccups". 
The can has a purple iridescent sludge oozing out of it that's really similar to the shade of purple that your hands are.
Come to think of it, you vaguely remember signing up for a test group that was supposed to try out a new health drink.
Looks like your part time job as a barrista just wasn't paying the bills, nothing like easy money! The thing is you 
don't remember anything about going to a hotel last night, and you definitely don't remember anything about drinking a 24
pack of Fast Eddie's Colon Cleanse. Your stomach starts to feel a little uneasy, but never mind that, it's time to 
spend some of that hard earned cash! You reach into your wallet and realize in that moment that you don't even remember 
your name. You look at your license and focus your still hazy eyes and barely make out that it says...{Name}.


When you open your wallet to pull out the cash all you find is a letter. It reads:

 

Dear {Name}.

Thank you so much for signing up to try out our exciting new drink! 
We hope you don't mind but we've taken the liberty of putting you up for the night
in one of our sponsors hotels with a generous supply of Fast Eddie's to keep you company.


One things for sure you reaaallly gotta go!


Welcome to "A Game of Thrones...Porcelain Thrones"



### Game Over Bathroom 201

#### <i>Location: Room 201 Bathroom</i>

You blatantly ignore the fact that there is a vicious Great Dane in the bathroom.
This brown baby is coming now! Unfortunately the dog does not ignore you and decides 
now would be a good time to rip your throat out. Game Over.

Trigger condition: Enter the bathroom again without the 


## Room Descriptions

### Room 201

 

As you look around the hotel room you see an old TV with rabbit ears that looks like it came straight
out of the 1950's. Against the wall there is a beat up night stand with a little drawer built into it
and an old {phone} on top. Next to it is a lumpy old {bed} that looks like it's seen better days with a
dark brown stain on the sheets and a funny smell coming from it. There is an obnoxious orange {couch} in
the corner next to a small {window} smudged with sticky purple hand prints, the stuffing is coming out of
the cushions which are also spotted with purple, and the floor is covered with {cans} of Fast Eddie's Colon
Cleanse.

There is a door to the west that leads to that sweet, sweet porcelain throne (Bathroom).
The door that leads to the hallway is to the east.

### Room 201 - Bathroom

You crack open the door to the bathroom and it looks like it's seen better days. From the smell of it, it looks like
someone beat you to it and narrowly escaped a hard fought battle with an eight pound burrito. The {sink} is old and yellowed.
and caked with brown muck in the corners. The {mirror} is cracked and something is written on it red. You can't quite
make it out. But you don't care...you've gotta take a shit! You rush to be the first in line to make a deposit in the
porcelain bank {toilet}. But just as you are about to Drop it like it's hot you notice there is an angry {Great Dane}
guarding the toilet and he looks hungry! You quickly shut the door and somehow manage to not lose your shit (literally).
Looks like you have to find somewhere else to go if you value your junk...and your life.

### West Hallway

 

You eagerly enter the hallway leaving your room behind you to the West. The glow of the yellow fluorescent lights 
are complimented by the well-worn red carpet. The diamond pattern urges you forward.

To the East the diamond pattern stretches into more hallway
To the South there is a small alcove with a vending machine
To the West the door to Room 201 (Your Room)

### Vending Machine Alcove

The vending alcove is in stark contrast to the rest of your well-worn surroundings. 
The vending machine is shiny and new and stocked to the brim with Fast Eddie's colon cleanse, as well as some other 
interesting items. A marquee taunts you in large bold letters "Fast Eddie's: When in doubt, flush it out!"

### East Hallway

You rush into the east hallway. It looks a hell of a lot like the west hallway. There's a few of your stereotypical hotel paintings hung on the walls.

But unless you can use them to wipe your ass right now, you don't care!

 
To the North is Room 204 (Paranoid Guy Hiding OUt)
To the NorthEast there is a door marked Fire Exit that leads to some dimly lit stairs. 
To the East there is a door marked Supply Closet. 
To the South there is an Elevator that hopefully leads somewhere with a toilet.  
Back to the West is the stretch of hallway you just came from.
